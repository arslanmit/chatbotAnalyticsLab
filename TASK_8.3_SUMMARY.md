# Task 8.3 â€“ Data Backup & Recovery

## Highlights

- Introduced a `BackupManager` that exports conversations to JSON/Parquet with retention-based rotation and optional restoration workflows (`src/services/backup_manager.py`).
- Added file utilities and configuration knobs for backup directories, formats, and retention, integrating with dataset uploads and conversation persistence (`src/utils/files.py`, `src/config/settings.py`, `src/api/routes/datasets.py`).
- Ensured backups are ready for automation and logging through monitoring hooks and repository updates.

## Key Outputs

- Datasets can now be backed up/restored via code, producing timestamped artifacts under configurable paths.
- Automatic cleanup keeps backup directories within retention limits.
- Implementation plan updated to reflect completion of the data backup milestone.
