# Task 5.3 â€“ Experiment Tracking and Management

## Highlights

- Introduced `ExperimentTracker` for persistent run logging, artifact registration, and metric-based comparisons stored under `experiments/experiments.json`.
- Integrated the tracker with the training pipeline so every run automatically records metadata, tags, run summaries, and evaluation outputs.
- Extended hyperparameter optimization to reuse the tracker, providing consistent bookkeeping of multi-trial experiments.

## Key Outputs

- Structured experiment history with quick filtering, best-run comparisons, and artifact lookups.
- Automated run summaries saved alongside logged experiments, keeping model, evaluation, and metadata files linked.
- Updated service exports to make experiment tracking readily available to CLI/API integrations.
