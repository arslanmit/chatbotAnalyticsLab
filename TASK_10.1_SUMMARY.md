# Task 10.1 – Unit Tests for Core Components

## Highlights

- Added pytest configuration + fixtures to run against an isolated in-memory SQLite database with custom settings (`pytest.ini`, `tests/conftest.py`).
- Implemented focused unit tests covering persistence repositories, backup manager, and alert evaluation logic (`tests/test_persistence.py`, `tests/test_backup_manager.py`, `tests/test_alerts.py`, `tests/factories.py`).
- Ensured backup/monitoring modules are exercised by tests, validating conversations are stored/retrieved, backups generate usable artifacts, and alert thresholds fire correctly.

## Key Outputs

- `python3 -m pytest` now runs a deterministic suite (5 tests) providing immediate regression coverage.
- Shared dataset factory simplifies future test additions.
- Implementation plan updated to mark Task 10.1 complete.
