Overview: 

This assignment challenges students to explore, implement, and critically evaluate a wide 
range of chatbot analytics techniques, from foundational performance metrics to advanced 
testing, personalization, and visualization strategies. Through a combination of research-
driven analysis and hands-on experimentation, students will address real-world challenges in 
chatbot optimization. The final report will demonstrate technical proficiency in using analytics 
tools, a user-centric and ethical approach to design, and the ability to communicate insights 
clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Task 1: Strategic Design of Chatbot Analytics Framework (20 Marks) (LO1)
▪ Design a comprehensive analytics strategy for a customer support chatbot used in a retail 
banking environment.
▪ Your strategy should include relevant chatbot performance metrics, user interaction logging, 
and business KPIs.
▪ Justify your selection of analytics types (e.g., A/B testing, funnel analysis, etc.) and how they 
contribute to innovation in performance evaluation.

Task 2: Research and Critique of Industry Optimization Approaches (20 Marks) (LO2)
▪ Select two industry-specific case studies involving chatbot optimization (e.g., travel, 
healthcare, or e-commerce sectors).
▪ Analyze how these organizations used analytics tools, retention/churn modeling, 
or ROI analysis to optimize chatbot performance.
▪ Compare these approaches with current trends such as adaptive dialog flow models, 
multivariate testing, and prompt engineering for LLMs.

Learning Outcomes:
LO1: Design and implement analytics strategies for chatbots, apply natural language 
processing (NLP) techniques to analyse user interactions and sentiment, fostering 
innovation in chatbot performance evaluation.
LO2: Conduct comprehensive research on industry-specific chatbot optimization 
challenges, critically analyse case studies and emerging trends to develop data-driven 
optimization strategies tailored to real-world applications.
LO3: Actively engage with practical projects to optimize chatbot performance, focusing 
on user-centric design, personalized responses, and ethical considerations, and 
communicate their findings effectively to non-technical stakeholders, bridging the gap 
between theory and practical implementation.

Task 3: Practical Implementation and Evaluation of Chatbot Analytics (25 Marks) (LO3)
▪ Choose one of the following chatbot options as your base:
➢ A chatbot you developed in the previous semester (e.g., using Rasa, Dialogflow, or 
BotPress).
➢ A free, ready-made open source chatbot (e.g., from Rasa GitHub examples, BotPress 
demo bots, or Hugging Face spaces).
▪ Using your selected chatbot, integrate or simulate an analytics feature focused on one of the 
following areas:
➢ Session heatmaps (e.g., user click paths or time-on-node visualizations)
➢ User segmentation & personalization (e.g., by intent frequency, channel usage)
➢ Accessibility or fallback optimization techniques
▪ You may use tools such as:
▪ Python with Plotly/Dash for interactive visualizations
▪ Rasa Analytics plug-ins or telemetry integrations
▪ Flask with Matplotlib or Seaborn for simple analytics dashboards
▪ Google Colab for running and showcasing the implementation
▪ Discuss how your implementation:
➢ Help improve chatbot performance and user satisfaction
➢ Addresses ethical design, transparency, and explainability

Task 4: Critical Evaluation and Testing Strategy (20 Marks) (LO1 & LO3)
▪ Propose a robust evaluation strategy for your chatbot use:
➢ A/B testing
➢ Statistical testing for dialogs
➢ Dialogue anomaly or intent drift detection
▪ Critically reflect on how each testing method supports user-centric improvements and 
innovation.

Task 5: Insightful Reporting and Visualization (15 Marks) (LO1, LO2 & LO3)
▪ Propose a final dashboard design for your chatbot analytics using real or simulated data.
▪ Your dashboard should:
▪ Present cross-platform performance, user journey attribution, and feedback/implicit 
signals
▪ Support decision-making through visual insights
▪ Reflect on how this reporting structure helps non-technical stakeholders understand 
performance insights.
