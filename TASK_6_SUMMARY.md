# Task 6 â€“ API Services Layer (6.1 & 6.2)

## Highlights

- Introduced a production-ready FastAPI app factory (`src/api/app.py`) with modular routers, CORS support, and dependency wiring.
- Implemented dataset, intent, conversation, and training endpoints that leverage existing services for preprocessing, analytics, and pipeline orchestration.
- Added monitoring endpoints (`/health`, `/health/info`) supplying readiness and configuration insights for basic observability.

## Key Outputs

- Reusable dependency providers (`src/api/dependencies.py`) that expose shared services and cached intent classifiers.
- Comprehensive Pydantic schemas covering datasets, intents, conversations, and training workflows for request/response validation.
- Training and hyperparameter endpoints capable of synchronous or background execution, tying into experiment tracking and model registry infrastructure.
