# Task 5.1 â€“ Automated Training Pipeline

## Highlights

- Implemented `ModelRepository` to version and persist trained models with metadata, enabling reproducibility and lifecycle management.
- Added configurable `TrainingPipeline` service that loads datasets, preprocesses data, orchestrates training, runs detailed evaluation, and writes structured run reports.
- Established run logging, artifact directories, and JSON summaries to capture configurations, split sizes, and performance metrics end-to-end.

## Key Outputs

- Versioned model artifacts stored under `models/registry/<model_id>/vN` with rich metadata and evaluation pointers.
- Pipeline runs created in `pipeline_runs/<model_id>_<timestamp>/` containing logs, evaluation outputs, and `run_summary.json`.
- Ready-to-use exports in `src/services/__init__.py` for integrating the training pipeline into CLI, API, or automation workflows.
