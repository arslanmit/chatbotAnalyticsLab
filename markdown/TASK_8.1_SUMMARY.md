# Task 8.1 â€“ Database Schema & Connections

## Highlights

- Introduced SQLAlchemy engine/session management with `init_db()` so the system maintains a persistent SQLite backend (`src/repositories/database.py`, `src/main.py`).
- Defined ORM models for experiment runs, model artifacts, and dataset records to support structured analytics storage (`src/repositories/orm.py`).
- Added repository helpers to persist experiment summaries, model versions, and dataset metadata directly from existing workflows (`src/repositories/persistence.py`, `src/services/experiment_tracker.py`, `src/repositories/model_repository.py`, `src/api/routes/datasets.py`).

## Key Outputs

- Training pipeline and API calls now populate the database automatically alongside JSON logs.
- Database schema creation happens during app initialization, readying the platform for future queries and dashboards.
- Implementation plan updated to mark Task 8.1 complete.
