# Task 7.3 â€“ Interactive Dashboard Features & Exports

## Highlights

- Added auto-refresh controls and alerting to keep overview metrics and sentiment warnings up to date without manual reloads (`dashboard/app.py`).
- Implemented date-range filtering, dataset sampling, and top-N selectors so analysts can slice experiments and analytics interactively.
- Delivered CSV/PDF export helpers based on shared utilities, enabling quick report downloads across experiments, intents, flow, and sentiment views (`src/dashboard/exporter.py`).

## Key Outputs

- Streamlit navigation now supports live refresh intervals, manual cache busting, and contextual warnings when KPIs degrade.
- Experiments page offers date filters plus export buttons; analytics tabs provide download options for the current chart data.
- Documentation updated to reflect completion of the dashboard interactivity milestone.
