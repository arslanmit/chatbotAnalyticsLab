# Task 7.1 â€“ Streamlit Dashboard Scaffold

## Highlights

- Built a Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`) with sidebar navigation, overview, and experiments tabs using shared services.
- Added reusable data loader utilities (`src/dashboard/data_loader.py`) to pull experiment metrics and recent runs from the tracker for display.
- Provided quick navigation and refresh controls so analysts can inspect the latest experiments without restarting the app.

## Key Outputs

- Dashboard package (`dashboard/`) ready for additional analytics pages and visualizations.
- Overview metrics derived from experiment history (counts, success rate, latest accuracy) visible on load.
- Documentation updated to reflect the completed dashboard scaffolding milestone.
