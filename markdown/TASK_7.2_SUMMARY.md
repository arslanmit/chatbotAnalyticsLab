# Task 7.2 â€“ Analytics Visualization Pages

## Highlights

- Added new dashboard tabs for Intent Distribution, Conversation Flow, and Sentiment Trends with dataset selectors and interactive controls (`dashboard/app.py`).
- Implemented reusable analytics helpers to load datasets and compute flow, sentiment, and intent metrics with caching to keep the UI responsive (`src/dashboard/data_loader.py`).
- Enhanced dashboard exports so visualizations can reuse shared loaders and analyzers across additional components (`src/dashboard/__init__.py`).

## Key Outputs

- Rich Streamlit visualizations summarizing intents, dialogue states, and sentiment trajectories with automatic dataset preprocessing.
- Refresh controls to invalidate caches and reload experiment/dataset analytics on demand.
- Updated implementation plan noting the completion of Task 7.2 for future tracking.
