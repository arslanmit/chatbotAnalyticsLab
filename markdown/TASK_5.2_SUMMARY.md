# Task 5.2 â€“ Hyperparameter Optimization

## Highlights

- Added configurable early-stopping and checkpoint controls to `TrainingConfig`, enabling patience-based termination and best-model retention during training.
- Updated `IntentClassifier` to honor the new training options, wiring HuggingFace `EarlyStoppingCallback` and save limits into the training loop.
- Implemented `HyperparameterOptimizer` service with grid and random search strategies, producing ranked trial reports and tracking model artifacts for each run.

## Key Outputs

- Structured hyperparameter search summaries with trial metrics and artifact locations for fast comparison.
- Seamless integration with the `TrainingPipeline`, allowing automated multi-run experiments using existing dataset and repository infrastructure.
- Expanded service exports (`src/services/__init__.py`) so optimization utilities are ready for CLI/API consumption.
