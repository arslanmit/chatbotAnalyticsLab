### 3.3 Privacy and Compliance Measures

**PII Masking Strategy:**

| Data Type | Masking Approach | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Account Numbers** | Hash with salt | `acc_a3f8b2c9d1e4` |
| **Names** | Replace with placeholder | `[NAME]` |
| **Email Addresses** | Hash domain, mask local part | `u***@example.com` |
| **Phone Numbers** | Mask middle digits | `+1-555-***-1234` |
| **SSN/Tax IDs** | Hash completely | `ssn_hash_xyz123` |
| **Addresses** | Keep city/state only | `San Francisco, CA` |
| **Credit Card Numbers** | Keep last 4 digits only | `****-****-****-1234` |
| **Transaction Amounts** | Round to nearest $10 | `$150` (actual: $147.32) |

**GDPR Compliance:**

1. **Right to Access**: Provide user dashboard to view all logged interactions
2. **Right to Erasure**: Implement data deletion API with 30-day fulfillment
3. **Right to Portability**: Export user data in JSON/CSV format
4. **Consent Management**: Explicit opt-in for analytics tracking
5. **Data Minimization**: Log only necessary fields for analytics
6. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data solely for stated analytics purposes

**Data Retention Policies:**

| Data Category | Retention Period | Storage Location | Deletion Method |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Real-Time Events** | 7 days | Hot storage (Redis) | Automatic expiry |
| **Analytics Data** | 2 years | Warm storage (PostgreSQL) | Scheduled purge |
| **Aggregated Metrics** | 5 years | Cold storage (S3) | Manual archive |
| **PII-Containing Logs** | 90 days | Encrypted database | Secure deletion |
| **Audit Trails** | 7 years | Compliance archive | Regulatory hold |

**Security Measures:**

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: All data access logged with user attribution
- **Anonymization**: Irreversible anonymization after retention period
- **Data Segregation**: Separate production and analytics environments

### 4.4 Analytics Types and Justification

**A/B Testing Framework**

**Purpose**: Optimize conversation design, response strategies, and user experience elements

**Use Cases:**
1. **Greeting Personalization**: Test generic vs. personalized greetings
   - Hypothesis: Personalized greetings increase engagement by 15%
   - Metrics: Conversation completion rate, user satisfaction
   - Sample Size: 10,000 users per variant (95% confidence, 80% power)

2. **Response Length Optimization**: Test concise vs. detailed responses
   - Hypothesis: Shorter responses reduce abandonment by 20%
   - Metrics: Abandonment rate, comprehension (follow-up questions)
   - Duration: 2 weeks per test

3. **Quick Reply Buttons**: Test with vs. without suggested actions
   - Hypothesis: Quick replies reduce conversation turns by 30%
   - Metrics: Average turns, task completion time
   - Segmentation: By user experience level

**Statistical Rigor:**
- Minimum sample size calculations using power analysis
- Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
- Sequential testing with early stopping rules
- Stratified randomization by user segment

**Justification**: A/B testing provides causal evidence for design decisions, enabling data-driven optimization with measurable ROI. Banking customers expect efficient service, and A/B testing ensures every design choice improves user experience.

   Conversion (15%)
   ```
   - **Insight**: Strong interest but low conversion suggests need for incentives
   - **Action**: Offer limited-time promotions, personalized recommendations

**Analysis Techniques:**
- Cohort-based funnel analysis (by acquisition channel, user segment)
- Time-to-conversion analysis (identify optimal engagement windows)
- Multi-path funnel analysis (compare different conversation flows)
- Funnel visualization with drop-off annotations

**Justification**: Banking processes are inherently multi-step, and funnel analysis reveals exactly where customers struggle. Each percentage point improvement in conversion represents significant revenue impact (e.g., 1% improvement in loan applications = $500K annual revenue).

**Intent Drift Detection**

**Purpose**: Monitor changes in user intent distribution and detect emerging patterns or model degradation

**Detection Methods:**

1. **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
   ```
   PSI = Σ (Actual% - Expected%) × ln(Actual% / Expected%)
   ```
   - **Threshold**: PSI > 0.1 triggers investigation, PSI > 0.25 triggers retraining
   - **Frequency**: Daily calculation, weekly review

2. **KL Divergence**
   ```
   KL(P||Q) = Σ P(i) × log(P(i) / Q(i))
   ```
   - **Measures**: Divergence between current and baseline intent distributions
   - **Application**: Detect seasonal shifts, emerging trends

3. **Chi-Square Test**
   - **Null Hypothesis**: Current distribution matches baseline
   - **Significance Level**: α = 0.05
   - **Application**: Statistical validation of drift detection

**Drift Categories:**

| Drift Type | Cause | Example | Response |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Seasonal Drift** | Predictable patterns | Tax season increases "tax document" queries | Update seasonal models |
| **Sudden Drift** | External events | New product launch, regulatory change | Emergency model update |
| **Gradual Drift** | Changing user behavior | Shift from branch to digital banking | Scheduled retraining |
| **Concept Drift** | Intent meaning changes | "Mobile banking" evolves with technology | Intent taxonomy update |

**Automated Responses:**
- **Alert Level 1** (PSI 0.1-0.15): Notify data science team, increase monitoring
- **Alert Level 2** (PSI 0.15-0.25): Schedule model retraining within 1 week
- **Alert Level 3** (PSI > 0.25): Immediate model retraining, fallback to rule-based system

**Justification**: Banking customer needs evolve with economic conditions, regulatory changes, and product offerings. Intent drift detection ensures the chatbot remains accurate and relevant, preventing degradation in user experience. Proactive detection saves costs by preventing large-scale model failures.

---

**Conversation Path Analysis**

**Purpose**: Understand common dialogue patterns and optimize conversation flows

**Analysis Techniques:**
- **Sankey Diagrams**: Visualize conversation flow from intent to resolution
- **Sequence Mining**: Identify frequent intent sequences (e.g., balance check → transfer funds)
- **Markov Chain Analysis**: Model transition probabilities between conversation states
- **Clustering**: Group similar conversation patterns for optimization

**Justification**: Banking conversations often follow predictable patterns. Understanding these patterns enables proactive suggestions, streamlined flows, and better anticipation of user needs.

---

**Sentiment and Satisfaction Correlation**

**Purpose**: Link real-time sentiment with business outcomes and identify satisfaction drivers

**Analysis Approach:**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify features most correlated with satisfaction
- **Regression Models**: Predict satisfaction from conversation characteristics
- **Sentiment Trajectory**: Track sentiment changes throughout conversation
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify specific triggers for negative sentiment

**Justification**: Sentiment analysis provides early warning signals for customer dissatisfaction, enabling proactive intervention. Strong correlation between sentiment and retention makes this a leading indicator of business impact.

---

**Anomaly Detection**

**Purpose**: Identify unusual patterns indicating system issues, fraud, or emerging user needs

**Detection Methods:**
- **Statistical Anomalies**: Z-score, IQR-based outlier detection
- **Machine Learning**: Isolation Forest, Autoencoder-based detection
- **Time Series**: ARIMA-based forecasting with anomaly flagging
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Unusual user patterns (e.g., rapid-fire queries, off-hours access)

**Justification**: Banking requires robust fraud detection and system monitoring. Anomaly detection protects both customers and the institution while identifying opportunities for service improvement.
