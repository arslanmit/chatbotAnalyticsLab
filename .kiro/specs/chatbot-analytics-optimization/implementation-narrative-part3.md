• Low confidence (<60%): Offer alternatives
```

**Color-Coded Confidence**:
```
🟢 High Confidence (80-100%): Green indicator
🟡 Medium Confidence (60-80%): Yellow indicator
🔴 Low Confidence (0-60%): Red indicator
```

**Confidence Distribution Chart**:

### 6.2 Conversation Flow Explanation Mechanisms

#### Turn-by-Turn Flow Explanation

**Conversation State Tracking**:
Explain how the conversation progressed through different states.

```
Conversation Flow Explanation

Turn 1: User → "I want to check my balance"
  State: INTENT_RECOGNITION
  Intent: check_balance (92% confidence)
  Action: Retrieve account balance
  
Turn 2: Bot → "Your checking account balance is $1,234.56"
  State: INFORMATION_PROVIDED
  Action: Display balance
  
Turn 3: User → "Can I transfer some to savings?"
  State: INTENT_RECOGNITION
  Intent: transfer_funds (88% confidence)
  Context: Previous intent was check_balance
  Action: Initiate transfer flow
  
Turn 4: Bot → "How much would you like to transfer?"
  State: INFORMATION_GATHERING
  Action: Request transfer amount
  
Turn 5: User → "$500"
  State: VALIDATION
  Entity: amount=$500
  Action: Validate and confirm
  
Turn 6: Bot → "Transfer $500 from Checking to Savings. Confirm?"
  State: CONFIRMATION_PENDING
  Action: Await user confirmation
  
Turn 7: User → "Yes"
  State: EXECUTION
  Action: Execute transfer
  Result: SUCCESS
  
Turn 8: Bot → "Done! Your new balances: Checking $734.56, Savings $1,500"
  State: COMPLETED
  Success: True
```

**Decision Point Explanation**:
Explain why the system made specific decisions at each turn.

```
Turn 3 Decision Analysis

User Input: "Can I transfer some to savings?"

Decision: Classify as transfer_funds (88% confidence)

Reasoning:
1. Keyword "transfer" strongly indicates transfer intent (+0.45)
2. Mention of "savings" specifies destination account (+0.28)
3. Previous turn was check_balance, common sequence (+0.15)
4. User segment (Regular User) frequently does transfers (+0.10)

Alternative Considered:
• open_account (12% confidence) - "savings" could mean opening new account
  Rejected because: "transfer" keyword and context suggest existing account

Action Taken:
• Proceed with transfer flow
• Ask for amount (next required parameter)
• Maintain context from previous balance check
```

#### Context Retention Explanation

**Context Tracking Visualization**:
```
Conversation Context Tracking

Turn 1: "What's my balance?"
  Context: {
    "intent": "check_balance",
    "account_type": null,
    "amount": null
  }

Turn 2: "Your checking account balance is $1,234.56"
  Context: {
    "intent": "check_balance",
    "account_type": "checking",
    "balance": 1234.56
  }

Turn 3: "Transfer $500 to savings"
  Context: {
    "intent": "transfer_funds",
    "source_account": "checking",  ← Retained from Turn 2
    "destination_account": "savings",
    "amount": 500
  }

Context Retention: ✓ Successfully retained account type from previous turn
Benefit: User didn't need to specify source account again
```

### 6.3 Recommendation Rationale Displays

#### Personalized Recommendation Explanation

**Why This Recommendation?**
```
Recommended Action: Set up automatic savings transfer

Why we recommend this:
1. You frequently transfer money to savings (8 times in last 30 days)
2. Transfers are usually similar amounts ($400-$600)
3. Transfers happen around the same time (1st-5th of month)
4. Automatic transfers would save you time and ensure consistency

Potential Benefits:
• Save 5 minutes per month (no manual transfers)
• Never forget to save
• Build savings habit automatically
• Eligible for 0.5% bonus interest rate

Would you like to set this up?
```

**Product Recommendation Rationale**:
```
Recommended Product: Premium Savings Account

Why this matches your needs:
1. Your current balance ($50,000) qualifies for premium tier
2. You make frequent deposits (12 per month avg)
3. You rarely withdraw (2 per month avg)
4. Premium account offers 2.5% APY vs your current 1.5% APY

Estimated Benefit:
• Current annual interest: $750
• Premium annual interest: $1,250
• Additional earnings: $500/year

Based on your profile:
• Account value: $50,000 (Premium tier: $25K+)
• Transaction pattern: High deposits, low withdrawals (ideal for savings)
• Tenure: 3 years (loyal customer discount available)

Would you like to learn more or upgrade?
```

#### Feature Suggestion Explanation

**Why Enable This Feature?**
```
Suggested Feature: Low Balance Alerts

Why we suggest this:
1. Your balance dropped below $100 three times in last 60 days
2. Two of those instances resulted in overdraft fees ($70 total)
3. Low balance alerts would have prevented these fees
4. 85% of users with similar patterns find this helpful

How it works:
• Get SMS/email when balance drops below your threshold
• Set your own threshold (e.g., $200)
• Real-time alerts (within 5 minutes)
• Free service, no additional fees

Potential savings:
• Avoid overdraft fees: $35 per occurrence
• Estimated annual savings: $140 based on your pattern

Would you like to enable low balance alerts?
```

### 6.4 Error Explanation Approaches

#### User-Friendly Error Messages

**Technical Error Translation**:
```
Technical Error: "HTTP 503 Service Unavailable - Database connection timeout"

User-Facing Explanation:
"I'm having trouble connecting to our systems right now. This is a temporary 
issue on our end, not a problem with your account.

What you can do:
• Wait a minute and try again
• Use our mobile app for basic transactions
• Call our 24/7 support line: 1-800-XXX-XXXX
• Visit your nearest branch

I apologize for the inconvenience. Our team is working to resolve this."
```

**Prediction Error Explanation**:
```
Error: Low confidence prediction (42%)

User-Facing Explanation:
"I'm not entirely sure I understood your question correctly. This could be 
because:
• Your question might be phrased in a way I haven't seen before
• You might be asking about something outside my current capabilities
• There might be multiple ways to interpret your question

To help me understand better, could you:
• Rephrase your question in different words
• Provide more specific details
• Choose from these common topics:
  - Account Information
  - Payments & Transfers
  - Cards & Security
  - Loans & Credit
  - Talk to a Human Agent"
```

#### Root Cause Analysis Display

```

#### Actionable Error Recovery

**Error Recovery Guidance**:
```
Error Occurred: Unable to process your request

What happened:
I tried to retrieve your transaction history but encountered a technical issue.

Why it happened:
Our transaction database is temporarily unavailable due to scheduled maintenance.

What you can do right now:
1. ✓ View your balance (available)
2. ✓ Make transfers (available)
3. ✗ View transaction history (unavailable until 2:00 PM)
4. ✓ Download last month's statement (available)

Alternative options:
• Check your mobile app (may have cached transactions)
• Call automated phone system: 1-800-XXX-XXXX
• Visit online banking website
• Wait until 2:00 PM when maintenance completes

Would you like to try one of the available options?
