# Task 6.3 â€“ Performance & Monitoring Enhancements

## Highlights

- Added rate limiting and request metrics middleware to protect the API and capture latency/error telemetry (`src/api/middleware.py`, `src/api/monitoring.py`).
- Exposed `/health/metrics` alongside enhanced health info for quick operational insight, powered by shared monitoring dependencies.
- Introduced lightweight response caching for analytic-heavy endpoints (e.g., conversation trends) to improve response times under repeated queries.

## Key Outputs

- Centralized dependency providers now supply caches, metrics collectors, and shared services to all routes (`src/api/dependencies.py`).
- Conversation analytics endpoints take advantage of caching and provide richer analytics payloads.
- Updated documentation tracking Task 6.3 completion in the implementation plan.
