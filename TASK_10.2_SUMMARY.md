# Task 10.2 – Integration & Performance Tests

## Highlights

- Added FastAPI TestClient-based integration tests covering health, metrics, and alert endpoints (`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_api_integration.py`).
- Introduced performance smoke tests for the conversation flow analyzer to guard against regressions on larger datasets (`tests/test_performance.py`).
- Expanded fixtures/factories to support reuse across tests, enabling comprehensive coverage of persistence, backups, and alert logic.

## Key Outputs

- `python3 -m pytest` now executes 9 tests spanning repositories, backups, alerts, API integration, and performance checks.
- Test environment uses isolated in-memory SQLite DB and temp backup directories for deterministic runs.
- Implementation plan updated to mark Task 10.2 complete.
