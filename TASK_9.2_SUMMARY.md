# Task 9.2 â€“ Alerting & Notification System

## Highlights

- Added configurable alert thresholds/channels to settings with environment overrides (`src/config/settings.py`).
- Built alert evaluation + dispatch utilities supporting logging and webhook sinks (`src/monitoring/alerts.py`, `src/monitoring/__init__.py`).
- Extended health routes to surface alert checks and optional triggering, returning structured responses for clients (`src/api/routes/health.py`, `src/api/schemas/common.py`).

## Key Outputs

- `/health/alerts` now reports active alerts and can fan out to configured channels.
- Thresholds cover CPU, memory, and request latency; defaults log warnings but can be pointed to webhooks.
- Requirements updated (httpx) and monitoring hooks instrumented to facilitate future alerting integrations.
